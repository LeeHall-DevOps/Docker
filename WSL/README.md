## Try WSL preview features by joining the Windows Insiders Program

To try the most recent features or updates to WSL, join the Windows Insiders Program. Once you have joined Windows Insiders, you can choose the channel you would like to receive preview builds from inside the Windows settings menu. You can choose from:

- Dev channel: Most recent updates, but low stability.
- Beta channel: Ideal for early adopters, more reliable builds than the Dev channel.
- Release Preview channel: Preview fixes and key features on the next version of Windows just before its available to the general public.
